        Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the age of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom
        he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the
        club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona
        achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three
        successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player
        to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most
        goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The
        following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived
        career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer
        in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or
        in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of
        contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.
